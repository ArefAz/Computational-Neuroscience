# Computational NeuroScience Course Projects
This repository contains the course projects I carried out. You can access the implementation codes in `cnsproject` directory. For each of the projects, there is a separate directory that contains the scripts for running the codes in a `Jupyter Notebook`. The notebooks also present what the projects are trying to accomplish and the results from the experiments. 

### Requirements
python 3.8+

pytorch 1.7.1

matplotlib 3.3.4

sphinx 3.5.1 (only if you want to add documentation)

## About The Project
The goal of this project is to implement the basics of a spiking neural network. By completing this project, you will have a
simple framework for implementing spiking neural networks.

The project is divided into multiple phases. In each phase, you will complete
some part of this template. Follow the phases in order and complete the tasks.
The packages and/or modules to be modified are mentioned in each phase's
directives. Make sure to read the documentation of the module(s) before getting
started.
