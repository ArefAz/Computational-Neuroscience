# # Introduction
# 
# In this project, we simulate a system with two excitatory populations, indirectly
# connected with an inhibitory population in between. You can see the connections'
# scheme in the image below. In this system, we assume the two excitatory
# populations are equivalent (statistically not ideally). This system emulates
# a decision condition in the brain. Excitatory populations represents the areas
# of the brain that are making the decision, and the input currents represent the
# signal that affects the decision-making.

# The goal is to apply different inputs to these EPs and see what changes in the
# activity pattern of the populations. Also, different connection parameters and
# type of connections will be tested.
# 
# Abbreviations:
# 
# 1. EE: Excitatory to Excitatory connection
# 2. EI: Excitatory to Inhibitory connection
# 3. EE: Inhibitory to Excitatory connection
# 4. EP: Excitatory Population
# 5. IP: Inhibitory Population
# 
# # Experiments
# 
# We assume three types of connections for the experiments: EE, EI and IE, and
# EE1 and EE2 will be equal (in type of connection and the parameters).
# Likewise for EIs and IEs. connection_types[0] refers to EE, 1 to EI and 2 to IE.
# the same logic applies for $j_0$, $\sigma_0$ and $n_{connections}$ in
# random connection.
# 
# In all the experiments we fix these parameters unless mentioned:
# 
# $\sigma_{n_{time}} = 5$
# 
# $\sigma_{n_{neuron}} = 4$
# 
# $Total_{N_{neurons}}=1000$
# 
# $EP1_{N_{neurons}} = EP2_{N_{neurons}} = 400,$
# $EP_{u_{rest}} = -65mv, EP_{threshold}=-50mv, EP_{tau}=50$
# 
# $IP_{N_{neurons}} = 200,$
# $IP_{u_{rest}} = -65mv, IP_{threshold}=-60mv, IP_{tau}=25$
# 
# $\sigma_{0_{EE}}= \sigma_{0_{EI}}= \sigma_{0_{IE}}=0.2$
# 
# $ I_{base} = 20 $
# 
# $time_{sim} = 2000 ms$
# 
# Note: Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter with a degree of 3 is applied to populations'
# activities before plotting to smoothen out the plots and make them comprehensible.
# 
# ## Experiment #1
# 
# In the first experiment, we use dense connection for all three types of connections,
# Dense connection parameters:
# 
# $j_{EE}=0.1, j_{EI}=5, j_{IE}=20$
# 
# 
# 
# We also feed the same input to both excitatory populations to create a baseline.

# By observing the above plots, the difference between increasing the strength of
# IE connections and EI connections is visible. Increasing the strength of IE will
# not change things very much after some point, this is because this change decreases
# the whole system's activity consistently. But strengthening EI connections
# affects the excitatory population with lower input more than the other one.
# It could be explained more in this way: EI connections will be more powerful
# when the excitatory populations are more active; regardless of the EPs inputs,
# IP affects both EPs in the same way, if activity of one of them increases,
# the IP's suppression will be more intense. This intensity will diminish the
# EP1 activity but cannot fully overcome the activity of EP2. It seems like EP2
# is directly inhibiting the activation of EP1.
# 
# With these results, we now know that we can leverage number of IE connections in
# order to control the system in a consistent way.

# Using random connections, we clearly can see that the EP with
#  dominant input and IP activities
# are following the dominant EP's input, and the other EP's activity is following the opposite of
# the dominant one's activity but with a smaller slope.
# 
# # Summary
# 
# 1. The activities of populations are affected by the EP with dominant input current.
# 2. The activities of IP and dominant EP follow the dominant EP's input current.
# The EP with lower activity will follow the inverse of dominant EP input current.
# 3. The dense connections are very susceptible to difference in EPs inputs;
# that is with small amount of difference in the inputs, the activation of
#  EP with lower input will be diminished drastically.
# 4. In contrast, the random connections are very robust, and even with
# large amount of difference in EPs inputs, the one with lower input will stay
# active.
# 5. The randomness of connections have more effect in EI and IE connections compared
# to internal EE connections.
# 6. In all random connections scheme, slight increase in
#  number of EI connections makes the system to suppress the activity of EP
#   with lower input intensely. However, the increase in number of IE connections,
# decreases the system's activation almost uniformly in all populations.
# This also applies to $j_0$ parameters in dense connections.
# 7. Increase in number of EE connections will increase the overall activity of populations.
# 8. The activity plots of the system with random connections, more accurately follow
# the dominant population's input current. These plots in the system
# with dense connection scheme are very noisy and cannot be interpreted without
# heavy smoothing.
