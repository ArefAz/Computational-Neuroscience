TODO.

Implement this module in any way you are comfortable with. You are free to use
any visualization library you like. Providing live plotting and animations is
also a bonus. The visualizations you will definitely need are as follows:

1. F-I curve.
2. Voltage/current dynamic through time.
3. Raster plot of spikes in a neural population.
4. Convolutional weight demonstration.
5. Weight change through time.
