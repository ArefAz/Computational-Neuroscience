Code Manual
-----------
To complete this project, you will have to make modifications in **DenseConnection** and **RandomConnection** in \
`cnsproject.network.connections module`. Make sure to read the documentation provided in **AbstractConnection** \
beforehand. You can also define more modules inheriting **AbstractConnection** and defining different patterns \
of connectivity, if desired. Furthermore, you might need to modify *forward* method of your neural populations to \
be able to handle input from other populations. In other words, you will need to consider how to convert pre-synaptic \
spikes into current or make changes to support spike as input to *forward*.

Do not forget to implement the required visualization functions/classes. Use monitor to record the desired variables.
